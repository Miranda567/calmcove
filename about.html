<div class="story-page__text">
<p>WORLD SPA founders, principals at Brooklyn-based BK Developers, worked tirelessly for nearly a decade to bring the WORLD SPA vision to life. Reshaping a disused parking lot into a 50,000-square-foot wellness oasis was a passion project like no other for the BK team. In 2018, BK tapped RYBAK Development, another leading NYC real estate development and construction firm, forming a joint venture and creating more capacity to handle this large-scale project. The mandate was for complete and total authenticity, which meant sourcing and importing both the building materials and the equipment to run and operate each experience directly from the original source. Handmade Moroccan and Turkish tiles adorn the hammams, while authentic Kelo pine was imported from Northern Europe for the saunas and banyas. The equipment comes from leading European manufacturers skilled in creating the highest-quality wellness experiences.</p>
<p>We hope you agree that the result is an urban bathhouse and wellness club that is both large and expansive, while being welcoming and intimate. A place for simply connecting with yourself or hanging out and connecting with others.</p>

<p>
By incorporating authentic spa experiences from cultures around the world, WORLD SPA has created a new kind of wellness sanctuary that not only enriches and supports the local community, but also provides a welcome, inspiring and relaxing destination for travelers visiting the New York area.
